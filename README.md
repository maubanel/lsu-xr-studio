### HTML Tips

#### \<figure\>

Use \<figure\> when:
* You're displaying an image, illustration, video, chart, or diagram that relates to the surrounding content but is self-contained.
* You want to provide a caption for that media with \<figcaption\>.
* The content can be moved, referenced, or reused independently of the surrounding text.

#### \<header\> and \<nav\>
* Best practice to use a \<header\> tag with a \<nav\> inside
* Add an aria-label to \<nav\> of `<nav aria-label = "primary-navigation">...</nav>` especially if there are multiple nav menus (top, side footer ect...) for screen readers

#### \<main\>
* Add \<main\> around all \<sections\> tags

#### \<article\> \<section\>
>  Use \<article\> when the content:
* Can stand alone on its own.
* Could be syndicated or reused elsewhere (e.g., in RSS feeds).
* Has its own independent title, metadata (author, date), or byline.

> Use \<section\> when:
* You’re dividing a thematic part of a page or document.
*  The content is grouped logically, but not necessarily reusable outside the current context.
*  You’d give the section a heading, like a subsection of a page.

#### \<aside\>

> Use \<aside\> for a secondary portion in a web page
* Sidebars with links, bios, or widgets
* Callout boxes, tips, or related resources
* Pull quotes or highlighted info
* Contextual ads or promotional content
* Footnotes or additional commentary

#### Date and time
* use semantic markup for dates and times especially for events
